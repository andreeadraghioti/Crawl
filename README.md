# Web Crawl and Mirror Project

This project demonstrates how to crawl a website and replicate it on a local virtual machine. Using tools like curl or wget, the accessible content of an existing website (e.g., http://fmi.unibuc.ro) is downloaded and served through a configured web server. The setup aims to mimic the original website as closely as possible while restricting external access to only the necessary ports for browsing the site.

## Tools Used
- curl / wget
- Web server (Apache/Nginx)
- Virtual Machine
